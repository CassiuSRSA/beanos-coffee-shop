# beanos-coffee-shop

This is a fictional website AKA my 1st real project.

## Languages, libraries and frameworks used

This project is purely HTML and CSS.

I have tried to make websites before and then only end up making the hero section of the landing page.
After some careful consideration I realised where I was going wrong, this was there was no design to work towards.
Realizing this I started this design using Figma, you can find the desing with the link below:

After designing the project I mainly used flexbox to get the layout right, the only issues I have had thus far was getting the left and right picture to line up correctly.
Another challenge I am still trying to work around is getting the dots right on the menu section between the item and the price. (I dabbled in some ::before and ::after selectors here but to no avail).

All and all the project looks good, but obviously as always there is room for improvement.
